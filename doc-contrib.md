> We track every edit of the wiki, so don't do anything silly. Any malicious edits or deletions will result in a ban, both from the wiki and from usage of the bot.

## New Pages

1. Always use the **Markdown editor**, this helps us copy formatting easily and if we ever decide to migrate to a different wiki system, we can do so.
2. Look at other similar pages as a reference for formatting.
3. If you're documenting a new command, make sure it's in the `commands` folder.

## Existing Pages

Feel free to make any minor changes to improve readibility, formatting, spelling, grammer, etc - or to clarify information.

1. Don't remove any information without checking with us in the Support Server first.
2. Links to pages within the wiki should be in the form `[text](/link/to/page)` and not `[text](https://wiki.dotsbots.com/en/link/to/page)`

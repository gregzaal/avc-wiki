Gold patrons have access to the stable Gold bot, which works exactly the same as the free public bot but is far more stable because it handles far fewer users. It also has a number of extra features that aren't available on the free public bot for stability and performance reasons.

**[Become a Gold patron now.](https://www.patreon.com/pixaal)**

> If you are a Gold patron, read the [instructions post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/36309048) there to learn how to switch to the Gold bot.

Here is a list of all the features you'll unlock by becoming a Gold patron:

* **Separate Bot** that serves only Gold patron servers, for greater stability and performance (faster channel creation, renaming, deletion, and command response times).
* More advanced channel **template options**, like NATO numbering (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...), random word selection, and powerful **nestable expressions** for conditional naming (e.g. based on roles the channel creator has, what game is being played, and whether or not the creator is streaming)
* **Text channels** for every voice channel if you want them, so people can spam each other there instead of your #general chat.
* **Custom channel names** - let your users rename their own channel, even utilizing the full power of the template system.
* Command **restrictions** - prevent your users from using certain commands, like renaming their own channel ;)
* Use a word or phrase other than **"General"** in the channel name when no game or many games are being played.
* Detailed **logging** of voice channel creation, deletion, etc.
* Per-user customizable **bitrates** for audiophiles and anyone with bad internet.

You can use these features in a **single server only** - this is so that the Gold bot remains stable for everyone. If you want to use them in more than one server, you'll need to [upgrade](/sapphire-diamond-patrons) to Sapphire or Diamond to get your own private bot that you can use in many more servers.
    
> If you're [hosting your own bot](/self-hosting), these features are already enabled by default. Keep discord's rate-limiting in mind and use them at your own risk.

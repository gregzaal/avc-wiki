Sapphire and Diamond [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pixaal) tiers are very similar. Both give you your own private bot for superior stability and include all the features from the [Gold tier](/gold-patrons).

The main difference is that all Sapphire patron bots are hosted together on the same server. They won't be affected by activity of the free public bots and shouldn't effect each other too much, but they all share the same CPU and network resources.

Diamond bots give an extra level of reliability by being hosted on their own private server, completely separate from all other bots. Because of this they can also be used in almost as many discord servers as you like.

> If you are a Sapphire/Diamond patron and you haven't been contacted already, ping @pixaal in the [support server](http://discord.io/DotsBotsSupport) to get your bot set up.

# Sapphire

Sapphire patrons gain access to all the same features as [Gold patrons](/gold-patrons), as well as a few more:

* Your own **private bot** for superior performance and reliability. Not only are you no longer affected by downtime of the public bot or latency because of activity in other servers, you're also helping the public bot by removing the load your server puts on it. It's a win-win for everyone.
* You can use your bot on **up to 5 servers** instead of just one.
* Use a game's **Rich Presence** information in the channel name if it's available, such as the number of players in the actual game lobby, maximum number of players and available slots, the current mission type, difficulty, character class, etc.
* Use the **Rich party information in expressions** too - e.g. to display "Full" when the party is full, and "LFG" when it's not - or to detect whether certain template variables based on Rich Presence are even available for the current game.
* **Logging** of every voice channel join/leave in your server.

**[Become a Sapphire patron now.](https://www.patreon.com/pixaal)**
    
> If you're [hosting your own bot](/self-hosting), these features are already enabled by default. Keep discord's rate-limiting in mind and use them at your own risk.

# Diamond

Diamond patrons gain access to all the same features as [Sapphire](/sapphire-diamond-patrons#sapphire) and [Gold patrons](/gold-patrons), with the following additional perks:

* Your own **private server** in a geographic location of your choice to run your own private bot (17 locations available globally). While the Sapphire private bots are perfectly fine for most people, Diamond bots give you another layer of risk mitigation with unparalleled performance and reliability: an entirely separate server.
* You can use your bot on **up to 50 servers!*** Maybe let your friends use your bot in their servers too ;)
* Customize your bot's name and avatar if you want to :)

\* Too many huge servers may negatively affect bot performance, but many smaller servers or a couple big ones should be fine.

> Warning: Patreon's payment system is really dumb, regardless of when in the month you sign up, your next payment will be charged on the 1st of the next month. [From their docs](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/210291283-How-charge-up-front-works): 
> > New Patrons will be charged on the day they become your patron, giving them access to all content shared with their reward tier. On the 1st of the following month, they will simply return to being charged monthly at the beginning of the month.
> > 
> > Example: A patron joins your Patreon community on February 25th for $10 per month. They will be charged $10 on the day they join, February 25th, for February patronage. On March 1st, the Patron will be charged $10 for March patronage.
>
> This is because Patreon was designed to be a donation platform and not a membership platform. We're currently evaluating alternative platforms, but for now you'll just need to be aware of this and wait until the start of the month to avoid a potential double payment.
> 
> **If you signed up after the 15th and only noticed this issue after your second payment, you can @pixaal in the support server to request a refund of your original payment.**

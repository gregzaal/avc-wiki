This wiki can be edited by anyone with a Discord account.

If you wish to help translate it into your own language, we'd appreciate it :)

At the top right of every page is the globe icon language selector. If your language is listed there when clicking on it, you can immediately start translating the wiki into your language. If not, just pop into the [support server](https://discord.io/DotsBotsSupport) and ask us to enable your language.

# New Language

Once we've enabled your language, the first step is to translate the navigation sidebar on the left. We need to set this manually, so just send us (in the support server) a list of translations for every button like this:

> Home > **ホーム**
> Invite > **招待する**
> Support Server > **サポートサーバー**
> Usage > **使用法**
> Commands > **コマンド**
> ...

Then, you can start translating pages :)

Start by clicking each link in the sidebar, and creating the page.

# Page Translation

If a page has not been translated before, then you'll get a "This page does not exist yet" error when visiting it. This is normal. You need to click the "Create Page" button to create it and start writing your translation.

Please use the Markdown editor as this allows us to copy paste formatting easily.

In any URL on this wiki, you'll notice the language is shown - e.g. see the `/en/` in https://wiki.dotsbots.com/en/home. You can manually replace this with your language abbreviation, such as https://wiki.dotsbots.com/ja/home for Japanese and https://wiki.dotsbots.com/zh/home for Chinese.

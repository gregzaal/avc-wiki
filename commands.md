The default prefix for all commands is `vc/`, e.g. `vc/create`. You can also @mention the bot instead, like `@Auto Voice Channels create`.

If you change your prefix and then forget what it is, the only way to use the bot again would be to @mention it with the prefix command, e.g. `@Auto Voice Channels prefix vc/`.

To get more info about a particular command, type `vc/help commandname`.


# Common Commands

Here are the most commonly used commands. Further down this page is also a full alphabetical list of [all commands](/commands#list-of-all-commands).


### [vc/create](/commands/create)
Create a new [primary](/how-it-works#primary-and-secondary-channels) voice channel.

Primary channels are "button" channels that you click on to create a new secondary channels. The default channel name is "âž• New Session", but you can rename it to whatever you like by right clicking on it and editing it as usual. Discord supports [standard emoji](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) in voice channel names, but not custom or discord-specific emoji.

The primary channel will be created somewhere near the top of your server, you can move it down to wherever you like. Just **make sure that the bot has permission to create and edit voice channels there.**


### [vc/template](/commands/template)
Secondary channels that get created with primary channels will be named according to your template. This command lets you change the template. The default template is `## [@@game_name@@]`.

See here for a [full list of available template variables](/commands/template) that you can use to customize your channel names, including examples.


### [vc/private](/commands/private)
Make your voice channel private, preventing anyone from joining you directly.

Creates a "â‡© Join (username)" channel above you so people can request to join you. When someone joins that channel, the bot will send you a message asking you to approve/deny/block their request.


### [vc/lock](/commands/limit) or [vc/limit](/commands/limit)
Lock or set the user limit of your channel to prevent any more people from being able to join.

These two are actually the same command and are duplicated for convenience. If you do not add a number at the end (e.g. running `vc/lock`), it will set the user limit to the current number of users in the channel. If you do add a number (e.g. `vc/limit 5`), it will set the limit to that number.

If you want to do this permanently for all secondaries created by the same primary channel, either just edit the user limit of the primary channel itself, or use [vc/defaultlimit](/commands/defaultlimit).


### [vc/ping](/commands/ping)
A quick test command to check the bot is working, and show its response time. Frequently high response times (>2s) may indicate performance issues.

Also displays the server region and region the bot is hosted in. The closer together these regions are the better your response times should be.


# List of All Commands

Below is a list of all commands grouped by Setup commands and Usage commands.

If you are using the free public bot, "ðŸ’³" indicates that the command can only be used by Gold [patrons](https://patreon.com/pixaal). If you're hosting your own bot, all commands can be used.

## Usage Commands

Commands that you may use regularly for controlling and modifying the channels you're in.

Most of these commands can be used by everyone in your server. Use the [restrict](/commands/restrict) command to prevent this if you don't want it.

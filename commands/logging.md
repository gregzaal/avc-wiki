Log voice channel activity in your server to a chosen text channel.

Use `vc/logging here` to enable logging to this channel, or enter a channel ID instead of here to use a different channel.
Use `vc/logging off` to disable logging.

You can optionally specify a logging level by adding `1`/`2`/`3` after your command (e.g. `vc/logging here 3`). The higher the level, the more info is logged:

* **Level 1** (default):
Someone creates a new channel; Someone tries creating channels too quickly and is temporarily put on cooldown; Someone initiates a votekick.
* **Level 2:**
Someone sets/removes the user limit of their channel; Someone sets a custom bitrate for themselves; Someone renames their own channel; An empty channel is deleted.
* **Level 3:**
Someone joins or leaves an existing channel.

Level 3 logging is only available to ðŸ’Ž Sapphire Patron servers, as it may generate a large number of messages which could overload the bot and trigger Discord's rate limiting.

If you don't specify a logging level and haven't done so before, level 1 will be assumed.

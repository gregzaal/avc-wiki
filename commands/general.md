If you use `@@game_name@@` in your channel name templates, when no game is detected or there are multiple games being played, the word "General" is used instead of any game name.

Use this command to change "General" to something else, like "Party", "Lounge", etc.

# Usage

> vc/general `SOMETHING`

# Example

* `vc/general Lounge`

Set a nickname for yourself that will be used only in voice channel names if `@@creator@@` is in the [template](/commands/template).

Does not change your actual Discord nick/name.

# Usage

> vc/nick `name`

# Examples

* `vc/nick Pix`
Will replace `@@creator@@` with "Pix" instead of your actual Discord name.
* `vc/nick reset`
Will remove your nick and use your actual Discord name in future.

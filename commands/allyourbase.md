Assume ownership of the channel you're in.
As an admin you can already use all *creator-only* commands even if you're not actually the creator, but this will now display you as the creator to everyone else.


# Usage

vc/allyourbase
> Use `vc/transfer` if you want to assign someone else as the creator.

Auto Voice Channels is an open-source Discord bot that allows users to create voice channels dynamically as they're needed, and delete them when they're not.

One of the main features is a complex name template scheme that allows channels to rename themselves dynamically based on a number of variables, such as the game being played by users in the voice channel, the name of the user who created it, the number of people, whether or not the creator has a specific role, Rich Presence information, etc.

There is an official [free public bot](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=479393422705426432&permissions=286280784&scope=bot) available, though it's currently very unstable due to its popularity. We recommend you either host the bot yourself (preferably on a VPS/dedicated server that stays online 24/7), or pay us to host a private bot for you.

1. To host the bot yourself, read the instructions on the [main GitHub page](https://github.com/gregzaal/Auto-Voice-Channels).
2. To pay us to host it for you, join one of the tiers on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pixaal) (from $3/m).
